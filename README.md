# example-app
Kubernetes, reactjs, postgresql, nginx and postgrest

This is an example application with an autogenerated backend using postgrest
on kubernetes. The frontend can be built into a nginx container and deployed
via kubernetes. The backend is dyanmically controlled via postgresql and 
postgrest. Although we use a docker-compose locally, we automatically support
deployment to kubernetes with kompose.


Preinstall

You will need 

 - pip
 - A new version docker https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/#install-docker

install docker compose using pip

```
You can use yarn to manage the server.
```
  yarn start

    Starts the development server.

```
  yarn build
```
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

```
  yarn test

```
  yarn eject

    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!


Backend Interace

Not much to do
