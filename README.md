# example-app
Kubernetes, reactjs, postgresql, nginx and postgrest

This is an example application with an autogenerated backend using postgrest
on kubernetes. The frontend can be built into a nginx container and deployed
via kubernetes. The backend is dyanmically controlled via postgresql and 
postgrest.


Frontend
--------
We generated this frontend using
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```
You can use yarn to manage the server.
```
  yarn start
```
    Starts the development server.

```
  yarn build
```
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

```
  yarn test
```
    Starts the test runner.

```
  yarn eject
```
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!


Backend Interace
--------

Not much to do


Nginx Proxy
--------

This is what actually servers our site.


Postgresql
--------

The database we store our data in.
